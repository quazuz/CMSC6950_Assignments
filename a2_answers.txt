1. How many earthquakes are listed in the table?
command: wc -l signif.txt.tsv
output: 5959

2. How many columns are in the table?
command: head -n 1 signif.txt.tsv | wc -w
output: 47


3. Use the cut command to create a new file that just has the data from the columns for YEAR, EQ_PRIMARY and COUNTRY. Hint: you can get the column numbers by using the head command to view the first row and then visually count the column numbers for the above fields (there is also a unix command to do this, but we didn't cover it in class). Call the new data file 'Year_Mag_Country.tsv'. You can use 'Year_Mag_Country.tsv' for the rest of the exercises below.

command: cut -f 3,10,18 signif.txt.tsv | cat > Year_Mag_Country.tsv

4. EQ_PRIMARY is the assigned earthquake magnitude. With your new file 'Year_Mag_Country.tsv', sort the data based on the numeric value of the EQ_PRIMARY column, then list the lines for the top ten largest earthquakes.

command: sort -k 2 -n  -r Year_Mag_Country.tsv | head -n 10 
Output: 
1960	 9.5	CHILE
1964	 9.2	USA
2011	 9.1	JAPAN
2004	 9.1	INDONESIA
1952	 9.0	RUSSIA
1700	 9.0	USA
2010	 8.8	CHILE
1812	 8.8	USA
1716	 8.8	PERU
1965	 8.7	USA

5. How many unique countries are listed in the database? Use cut,sort,uniq, wc and a few pipes | to form a single expression that answers this question?

Command: cut -f 3 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | sort | uniq -c | cut -f 2 | wc -l
Output: 154

6. Use the grep command to count how many earthquakes in the database are located in the USA or USA TERRITORY?
Command 1: cat Year_Mag_Country.tsv | grep -e "USA TERRITORY" -e "USA" -c 
OR
Command 2:  cat Year_Mag_Country.tsv | grep -e "USA" -c
Output: 294

7. Expanding on the previous exercise, refine your command sequence so that it only counts earthquakes in the USA and not ones in USA TERRITORY. Hint: use the -v argument with grep and you may need to call grep more than once?
Command: cat Year_Mag_Country.tsv | grep "USA" | grep -v "USA TERRITORY" -c
Output: 255

8. Compute the total number of earthquakes in each country and then display the top ten countries along with the number of earthquakes. Hint: this can be done with a command sequence similar to exercise 5, but requires a specific argument to be used with uniq.

Command:  cut -f 3 Year_Mag_Country.tsv  |sort  |uniq -c | sort -nr -k 1|head -n 6
Output: 
 579 CHINA
 400 JAPAN
 365 IRAN
 363 INDONESIA
 324 ITALY
 319 TURKEY
 259 GREECE
 255 USA
 207 PHILIPPINES
 193 MEXICO


9. Create a shell script named countEq.sh that returns the total number of earthquakes for a given country, where the country is specified as the option when calling the script.

Command:
# Creating the file and making it executable
touch countEq.sh
chmod +x countEq.sh
nano countEq.sh
# The script
cat Year_Mag_Country.tsv | grep -wc $1$


Example: ./countEq.sh USA
Output: 255

10. 
Command:
# Creating the file and making it executable
touch countEq_getLargest.sh
chmod +x countEq_getLargest.sh
nano countEq_getLargest 
# The script

total=$(cat Year_Mag_Country.tsv | wc -l)
echo $total "Total number of earthquakes"

largest=$(cat Year_Mag_Country.tsv | grep -wi "$1$" | sort -n -k 2 | head -n 1 | cut -f 1)
echo "The largest earthquake" in $1 is $largest

Example: ./countEq_getLargest.sh CHILE

11. Compute the total number of earthquakes each year and then output a sorted list of the top ten years with the most earthquakes. Paste your command and the top ten list below.

Command:  cut -f 1 Year_Mag_Country.tsv  |sort  |uniq -c | sort -nr -k 1|head -n 10
Output: 
 78 2004
  77 2008
  72 2003
  67 2007
  62 2010
  61 2006
  60 2009
  60 2005
  60 2002
  59 2011

12.Create a shell script that loops over the top ten years with the most earthquakes (from exercise 11), finds all the earthquakes for a given year and writes them to file named $YEAR-earthquakes.txt, where $YEAR is the for loop variable assigned from the top ten list. Your code should output ten different files (one for each year in the top ten list). Hints: Take your answer from exercise 11 and extract the year column, then use this for the range in a for loop by inserting them like this for YEAR in $(insert code that lists top ten years here). The rest is just a grep and a redirect > to a file with the correct name.


Command
for YEAR in $(cut -f 1 Year_Mag_Country.tsv  |sort -nr -k 1| uniq -c| head -n 10 | cut -d " " -f 4);
do
 cat Year_Mag_Country.tsv | grep $YEAR >> $YEAR."-earthquakes.txt";
done
